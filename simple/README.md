This is an implementation of a toy C-like language and a small assembler in Haskell (via Parsec).

The language, currently codenamed Simple, compiles to the assembler, which can run on a custom processor made for testing on FPGAs. A description of the processor instruction set and the assembler can be found [on the processor repository main page](https://github.com/gibiansky/verilog-multicycle-processor).
