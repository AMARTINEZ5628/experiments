Projects
========

This is a repository of various small projects that I've found interesting. 

__Projects__:
* fluids/ - Experiments with a fluid simulation method known as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Includes a complete description of the simulation method, starting from fundamental fluid mechanics to derive the Navier-Stokes equations, followed by a derivation of the simulation steps from the Navier-Stokes equations. Also includes a very quick and dirty Java implementation of the simulation method. Also available as a pair of [blog posts](http://www.gibiansky.com/2011/07/computational-fluid-dynamics.html) for more detail.
* morph/ - Experiments with simple image interpolation / morphing. Take a look at [the blog post](http://www.gibiansky.com/2011/07/image-morphing.html) for more detail.
