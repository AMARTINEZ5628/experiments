Projects
========

This is a repository of various small projects that I've found interesting. 

__Projects__:
* lbm/ - Simple implementation of the Lattice Boltzmann method; described a little bit on one of my blog posts.
* fluids/ - Experiments with a fluid simulation method known as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Includes a complete description of the simulation method, starting from fundamental fluid mechanics to derive the Navier-Stokes equations, followed by a derivation of the simulation steps from the Navier-Stokes equations. Also includes a very quick and dirty Java implementation of the simulation method. Also available as a pair of [blog posts](http://www.gibiansky.com/2011/07/computational-fluid-dynamics.html) for more detail.
* morph/ - Experiments with simple image interpolation / morphing. Take a look at [the blog post](http://www.gibiansky.com/2011/07/image-morphing.html) for more detail.
* neural-network/ - An implementation of a feed-forward neural network in MATLAB for handwritten digit recognition. For information on neural networks, take a look at the following [explanation](http://www.gibiansky.com/2012/08/machine-learning-neural-networks.html).
* cpu/ - A toy CPU created in Verilog for use with a Cyclone II Altera Starter Kit FPGA board. The CPU executes (compiled versions of) a custom MIPS-like assembly language; the compiler for this language and the description are in simple/.
* simple/ - A toy C-like language called "Simple", which compiles to a custom MIPS-like assembly, which can execute on a custom CPU for a Cyclone II FPGA board.
* quadcopter/ - A detailed description of quadcopter motion dynamics and the control used for quadcopter stabilization. Includes a simulation and movie.
